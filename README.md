Adaptive Resistance Principle (ARP)

# Adaptive Resistance Principle (ARP) Theory, Simulation, and Applications

## Abstract  
** Adaptive Resistance Principle (ARP) is introduced as a novel principle governing adaptive resistor networks that actively adjust their resistances in response to electrical stimuli. Inspired by the behavior of electrorheological (ER) fluids and self-organizing biological systems, this law provides a theoretical framework for circuits that reconfigure themselves to optimize performance. We present the mathematical formulation of McKenna’s Law and its connections to known physical laws (Ohm’s law, Kirchhoff’s laws) and analogs in nature. A simulation model is developed to implement the proposed dynamic resistance updates, and results demonstrate emergent behavior such as automatic formation of optimal conductive pathways and minimized power dissipation. We discuss the significance of these results, comparing the adaptive network’s behavior to similar phenomena in slime mold path-finding and ant colony optimization. Finally, we explore potential applications of McKenna’s Law in circuit design, optimization algorithms, and self-organizing networks, highlighting how dynamically adaptive resistive elements could lead to robust and efficient systems. The paper concludes with a summary of key contributions and an outline of future research directions, including experimental validation and broader computational implications.

## Introduction  
Adaptive resistance networks are systems of electrical components whose resistance values can change in real time in response to external conditions or internal network states. Such adaptivity is analogous to **smart materials** in other domains. A prime example is **electrorheological (ER) fluids**, which are suspensions that dramatically alter their viscosity (mechanical “resistance” to flow) under an applied electric field ([Electrorheological fluid - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrorheological_fluid#:~:text=Electrorheological%20,and%20wrote%20an)). In the absence of a field, an ER fluid flows freely like a liquid, but when an electric field is applied, suspended particles polarize and form chain-like structures, causing the fluid to behave like a near-solid with greatly increased viscosity ([
            Electrorheological Fluids of GO/Graphene-Based Nanoplates - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8746257/#:~:text=ER%20fluids%20show%20a%20Newtonian,like%20state%20possessing%20yield)). This **Winslow effect** (after its discoverer Willis Winslow in 1949) is reversible on the order of milliseconds, allowing ER fluids to toggle between liquid and solid states rapidly ([Electrorheological fluid - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrorheological_fluid#:~:text=Electrorheological%20,and%20wrote%20an)). The ability to dynamically control resistance to flow has inspired researchers to envision analogous behaviors in electrical networks, where an applied stimulus could trigger reconfiguration of conductive pathways.

In nature, several systems display **adaptive path optimization**, providing inspiration for engineered networks. A notable example is the slime mold *Physarum polycephalum*, an amoeboid organism that can form efficient networks of protoplasmic tubes. When presented with a maze or multiple food sources, *Physarum* redistributes its mass to connect targets via nearly the shortest path ([A mathematical model for adaptive transport network in path finding by true slime mold - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17069858/#:~:text=We%20describe%20here%20a%20mathematical,to%20the%20extent%20of%20the)). This behavior is driven by a simple local rule: a tube thickens (lowers its internal resistance) in proportion to the flux of nutrients flowing through it ([A mathematical model for adaptive transport network in path finding by true slime mold - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17069858/#:~:text=We%20describe%20here%20a%20mathematical,to%20the%20extent%20of%20the)). Over time, heavily used tubes become even more conductive, while unused ones wane, yielding a self-optimized transport network. Another analogy is found in ant colony foraging: ants lay down pheromones on the trails they travel, and shorter paths accumulate pheromone faster (because ants traverse them more frequently per unit time), which in turn attracts more ants ([Ants find the shortest path: A mathematical proof for Swarm Intelligence - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/publications/ants-find-the-shortest-path-a-mathematical-proof#:~:text=In%20the%20most%20basic%20application,in%20the%20form%20of%20uniform)). This positive feedback mechanism leads the colony to favor and reinforce the shortest routes between nest and food, while a slow evaporation of pheromones prevents permanent lock-in to suboptimal paths ([Ants find the shortest path: A mathematical proof for Swarm Intelligence - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/publications/ants-find-the-shortest-path-a-mathematical-proof#:~:text=In%20the%20most%20basic%20application,in%20the%20form%20of%20uniform)). These biological algorithms – slime mold network adaptation and ant colony optimization – highlight the power of simple local feedback rules in achieving global optimization of paths.

Motivated by these examples, our research seeks to bring similar adaptivity into electrical circuits. We propose **McKenna’s Law of Dynamic Resistance** as a governing principle for networks of resistors that can adjust their resistance values in response to electrical current flow. In essence, McKenna’s Law posits that an electrical conductor will decrease its resistance when subjected to higher currents (reinforcing frequently used pathways), and conversely increase its resistance when carrying little or no current (suppressing underused pathways). By implementing this law in a simulated network, we aim to investigate whether the emergent behavior leads to improved performance – for example, finding paths of least electrical resistance analogous to how ER fluids increase mechanical resistance or how slime molds find short routes. This adaptive mechanism has potential applications in **self-healing circuits**, **analog optimization hardware**, and **reconfigurable networks** that can respond to changing conditions without external reprogramming. In the following sections, we develop the theoretical framework for McKenna’s Law (drawing connections to existing physical and computational principles), describe the methodology for simulating such a dynamic resistive network, present results of our simulations along with analysis, and discuss practical applications and future directions of this work.

## Theoretical Framework  
McKenna’s Law of Dynamic Resistance provides a rule for how the resistance of an element in a network evolves over time as a function of the electrical current flowing through it. In a traditional static network, Ohm’s law ($V = IR$) and Kirchhoff’s circuit laws fully determine the currents and voltages for fixed resistances. Here, we extend this paradigm by allowing each resistor’s value $R(t)$ to be time-dependent, creating a coupled system where currents influence future resistances. **McKenna’s Law** can be stated as follows:

- *“The rate of change of a resistor’s conductance is proportional to the current flowing through it, with a tendency to increase conductance on heavily utilized connections and to decrease conductance on scarcely utilized ones.”* 

Mathematically, one convenient form of this law is expressed in terms of conductance $G_{ij}(t) = 1/R_{ij}(t)$ for the connection (edge) between node $i$ and $j$ in the network. We define: 

$$\frac{d}{dt} G_{ij}(t) = \alpha\, f\!\big(|I_{ij}(t)|\big)\;-\; \mu\, G_{ij}(t), \qquad (1)$$

where $I_{ij}(t)$ is the instantaneous current through the resistor, $\alpha$ is a positive constant scaling the **reinforcement** effect, $\mu$ is a positive constant for a **decay** (or “evaporation”) effect, and $f(\cdot)$ is an increasing function representing the sensitivity of conductance growth to current magnitude. Equation (1) encapsulates the core idea of McKenna’s Law: if a large current flows through the element, the term $f(|I_{ij}|)$ will be large, and conductance $G_{ij}$ will increase (meaning resistance $R_{ij} = 1/G_{ij}$ drops); if little or no current flows, the decay term $-\mu G_{ij}$ will dominate, causing conductance to decrease (i.e. resistance to rise back up). This dual mechanism ensures that frequently used links become more conductive over time, whereas seldom-used links become more resistive (and may effectively cut off if $G$ decays toward zero). The form of $f$ can be chosen based on the application – common choices might be a linear function $f(I)=I$ or a saturating nonlinearity to impose a maximum conductance. For simplicity and analytical tractability, in our model we often take $f(|I|)=|I|$ so that: 

$$\frac{d G_{ij}}{dt} = \alpha\, |I_{ij}| - \mu\, G_{ij}. \qquad (2)$$

This linear model is directly inspired by biological network adaptation laws. In fact, the same form appears in the mathematical model of slime mold tube dynamics proposed by Tero *et al.* ([(PDF) Physarum-inspired Network Optimization: A Review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321719515_Physarum-inspired_Network_Optimization_A_Review#:~:text=d)). There, the conductance $D_{ij}$ of a tubular vein in *Physarum* increases with flux $|Q_{ij}|$ and decays otherwise, capturing the observation that “conductivities tend to increase in edges with big flux” ([(PDF) Physarum-inspired Network Optimization: A Review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321719515_Physarum-inspired_Network_Optimization_A_Review#:~:text=d)). McKenna’s Law can be seen as an electrical analog of that physiological mechanism, transposed into the domain of resistor networks. Similarly, the inclusion of a decay term $\mu G_{ij}$ mirrors the pheromone evaporation in ant colony systems ([Ants find the shortest path: A mathematical proof for Swarm Intelligence - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/publications/ants-find-the-shortest-path-a-mathematical-proof#:~:text=In%20the%20most%20basic%20application,in%20the%20form%20of%20uniform)), which is crucial for avoiding the persistence of inefficient routes by slowly penalizing unused paths. 

It is important to note that while resistors under McKenna’s Law are dynamic, the network at any given instant still obeys standard circuit laws. We assume that the electrical dynamics (voltage and current propagation) are fast relative to the adaptation of resistances, such that at each time $t$ we can consider the network to be in quasi-static equilibrium. This means that at each time step of integration, the instantaneous currents $I_{ij}(t)$ satisfy Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) at each node (conservation of charge flow) and Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) around each loop, just as in a static resistor network. The difference is that the conductances $G_{ij}(t)$ in those laws are continuously evolving by (1) or (2). In effect, the system is a **coupled electro-dynamical system**: the electrical problem (solve currents for a given set of resistances) is nested within the dynamical system (update resistances based on those currents).

McKenna’s Law has connections to existing physical components and principles. One related concept is the **memristor**, a two-terminal circuit element characterized by a resistance that depends on the history of current that has passed through it. As described by Caravelli and Carbajal, a memristor behaves like “a nonlinear resistor with memory” whose resistance (or conductance) is a function of an internal state variable influenced by past currents/voltages ([Memristors for the Curious Outsiders](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.03389#:~:text=proposed%20new%20approaches%20to%20performing,machine%20learning%20and%20neural%20computation)). Memristive devices implement a form of dynamic resistance at the materials level (e.g., via movement of ions or domain walls in a semiconductor). McKenna’s Law provides a higher-level phenomenological rule that could be implemented by networks of memristors or other adjustable components to achieve collective behavior. Another connection can be drawn to the principle of minimum energy dissipation in circuits: for a given distribution of applied voltages, a static resistor network settles into a state that minimizes total Joule heating (this is analogous to Thomson’s principle in electrical networks). The adaptive process described by McKenna’s Law effectively performs a search for configurations that reduce dissipation further – by *changing the conductances themselves*, the system can re-route currents to lower-resistance paths and thereby achieve even lower dissipation than the initial topology allowed. In summary, the theoretical framework establishes McKenna’s Law as a dynamic extension of classical circuit laws, enriched by parallels from biology and computation that guide the choice of its form. Next, we detail how this law can be implemented and tested in a simulation environment.

## Methodology  
To investigate the implications of McKenna’s Law, we developed a simulation model of an adaptive resistor network. The model consists of the following key components and steps:

- **Network Topology:** We consider a graph $G=(V,E)$ representing the electrical network, where $V$ is the set of nodes and $E$ the set of resistive connections between them. For simplicity, most simulations used an undirected planar network (e.g., a grid or a randomly connected graph), but the law is general to any topology. Each edge $(i,j)\in E$ has an initial resistance $R_{ij}(0)$ (or conductance $G_{ij}(0)$). Unless noted otherwise, we initialized all resistances to the same value (uniform network) to avoid biasing any particular path.

- **Boundary Conditions and Inputs:** To drive current through the network, we designate certain nodes as input or output terminals. In a typical scenario, one node is the source (at which a fixed current $I_0$ enters the network, or equivalently a fixed voltage is applied) and another node is the sink (where current leaves the network). This mimics, for example, connecting a battery across two points in a circuit. The remaining nodes have no external injection of current (they satisfy zero net current, obeying KCL). In some experiments we extended to multiple source and sink pairs to explore more complex routing, but the fundamental insights can be gained with a single source–sink pair.

- **Governing Equations:** At each simulation time step, we solve for the electrical state of the network given the current set of resistances. This involves solving Kirchhoff’s equations for the node voltages. Specifically, we solve the linear system obtained from KCL: for every non-source/sink node $j$, $$\sum_{i:\,(i,j)\in E} G_{ij}(t)\, [V_j(t) - V_i(t)] = 0,$$ which ensures the net current at node $j$ is zero (the term in brackets is the voltage difference, so $G_{ij}(V_j - V_i)$ is the current from $j$ to a neighbor $i$). For the source node, we set $V_{\text{source}}$ such that a desired current $I_0$ is injected, and similarly fix the sink node voltage (often one of these can be ground, $0$ V, for reference). This system of equations (a sparse linear system) is solved at each time step to find the node voltages $V_i(t)$, and from those the branch currents $I_{ij}(t) = G_{ij}(t)\,[V_i - V_j]$. The solution is efficiently obtained using standard linear algebra solvers for sparse matrices at each step.

- **Resistance Update Rule:** After computing the currents, the conductances are updated according to McKenna’s Law. We implement the update in discrete time with a small time step $\Delta t$ (or directly as an iterative map). Using Equation (2) from the theoretical section, one time-step update for each edge is: 
  $$G_{ij}(t+\Delta t) = G_{ij}(t) + \Delta t \left[\alpha\, |I_{ij}(t)| - \mu\, G_{ij}(t)\right].$$ 
  In practice, we choose $\Delta t$ and the parameters $(\alpha, \mu)$ to ensure numerical stability. The decay term $\mu G_{ij}$ prevents conductances from growing without bound and provides a form of competition between edges. If $\alpha$ is too large relative to $\mu$, the update becomes aggressively amplifying and can cause one path to dominate too quickly or even lead to oscillatory behavior. If $\alpha$ is too small, adaptation is sluggish and the network remains near its initial state for a long time. The ratio $\alpha/\mu$ roughly controls the sensitivity of the system – a concept analogous to the “feedback gain” in control systems or the pheromone reinforcement vs. evaporation rate in ant algorithms ([Ants find the shortest path: A mathematical proof for Swarm Intelligence - IBM Research](https://research.ibm.com/publications/ants-find-the-shortest-path-a-mathematical-proof#:~:text=In%20the%20most%20basic%20application,in%20the%20form%20of%20uniform)). In fact, previous studies of adaptive biological networks have noted that a **key parameter** (akin to $\alpha/\mu$) governs the richness of behavior: Tero *et al.* demonstrated that the slime mold model exhibits different network patterns depending on the feedback strength parameter ([A mathematical model for adaptive transport network in path finding by true slime mold - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17069858/#:~:text=through%20it%20increases,the%20model%20on%20this%20parameter)). In our simulations, we similarly varied $\alpha$ and $\mu$ to observe how quickly and how selectively the network responds to the imposed currents.

- **Implementation:** The simulation was implemented in Python, using libraries for linear algebra to solve the network equations at each step. For example, the network can be represented as an adjacency matrix of conductances, and at each iteration we solve $G \cdot V = I$ (modified by boundary conditions) to get node voltages. We then update each conductance. Pseudocode for one iteration is: 

  ```
  for each node j not a source or sink:
      sum_i G_ij * (V_j - V_i) = 0   (KCL)
  solve for V_j
  
  for each edge (i,j):
      I_ij = G_ij * (V_i - V_j)
      G_ij = G_ij + Δt * [α * |I_ij| - μ * G_ij]
  ```
  
  The process is repeated for many time steps until the conductances reach a steady state or a predefined number of iterations is completed. In steady state, $dG_{ij}/dt \approx 0$ in Eq. (2), implying $G_{ij} \approx \frac{\alpha}{\mu}|I_{ij}|$ for each edge. This relation in equilibrium says that each edge’s conductance is proportional to the current it carries (with the proportionality set by $\alpha/\mu$). Intuitively, the network stops changing when the distribution of currents is such that every link’s conductance matches the load on that link – a self-consistent state.

We verified that our implementation conserves total current and obeys energy conservation at each step (the instantaneous power dissipation equals the sum of $I_{ij}^2 R_{ij}$ over all edges, and this quantity was monitored). We also enforced constraints such as keeping all resistances within reasonable bounds (e.g., not letting any $R_{ij}$ drop to zero or negative, which we handled by a small floor value to avoid singularities in solving the circuit). Having established the simulation approach, we next describe the results observed from various simulation scenarios and their interpretation.

## Results & Discussion  
After running simulations under McKenna’s Law of Dynamic Resistance, the network consistently evolved towards states of improved overall conductivity between source and sink nodes. **One of the key results** is that the adaptive network spontaneously finds and reinforces low-resistance pathways, effectively performing a search for the electrical analog of a shortest path. Starting from a homogeneous grid of resistors, for example, we observed that as current was injected at a source and extracted at a sink, certain routes began to carry slightly more current (due to random fluctuations or minor differences if any). Those routes then had their conductances increased according to Eq. (2), which in turn attracted even more current (since a lower resistance path draws a larger share of current from the source, similar to a river widening to carry more flow). This positive feedback loop continued until a dominant pathway formed between the source and sink. Lesser-used branches, by contrast, gradually faded by becoming high-resistance dead-ends. The end result was a **tree-like subnetwork** connecting the source and sink with significantly lower total resistance than the original network. In quantitative terms, the effective resistance measured between the source and sink nodes dropped over time and converged to a much smaller value, indicating more efficient conduction. Likewise, the total power dissipation $I_0^2 R_{\text{eff}}$ (for a fixed source current $I_0$) also fell, meaning the network was dissipating less energy after reconfiguration.

To illustrate, in one simulation on a lattice network we placed the source and sink at opposite corners. Initially, current distributed over many parallel paths through the lattice. As the adaptation proceeded, one roughly straight corridor of conductive edges emerged. The resistors along this corridor ended up with conductances orders of magnitude higher than those on the periphery of the lattice (which effectively turned “off”). The final pattern resembled a **minimal spanning tree** or shortest path spanning the two corners. This is analogous to how *Physarum* slime mold connects two food sources directly after initially exploring a wide area ([A mathematical model for adaptive transport network in path finding by true slime mold - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17069858/#:~:text=We%20describe%20here%20a%20mathematical,to%20the%20extent%20of%20the)). Indeed, our electrical network showed a very similar behavior: initially, multiple pathways carry current (exploration), but eventually the redundant ones are pruned and only the optimal route remains (exploitation of the best path). The outcome confirms that McKenna’s Law leads to **self-organizing optimization** in the circuit. It is remarkable that a purely local update rule (each resistor only “knows” its own current) yields a global solution that appears to minimize the total path length or resistance.

We also analyzed the sensitivity of the results to the parameters $\alpha$ (reinforcement rate) and $\mu$ (decay rate). In line with theoretical expectations, the ratio $\alpha/\mu$ influences how selective the network is. With a high $\alpha/\mu$, the system quickly amplifies the slightest advantage of one path, leading to a very rapid convergence to a single path. However, if this ratio is too high, the system can become **unstable**: one path’s conductance might increase so quickly that it draws virtually all current, then overshoots (since as its resistance drops, the fixed-voltage source drives even more current than anticipated, possibly causing oscillatory adjustments). A moderate $\alpha/\mu$ yielded the smoothest convergence. Lower values of $\alpha/\mu$ made the adaptation more gradual; the network would still eventually favor an efficient path, but it took many more iterations to differentiate among paths. Interestingly, there is a trade-off similar to **exploration vs. exploitation** in optimization algorithms. A slower adaptation (low $\alpha$) keeps multiple paths viable for longer, exploring the space of possibilities more thoroughly, whereas a faster adaptation quickly exploits one path but might get stuck if that path wasn’t truly optimal (due to, say, a local fluctuation early on). In practice, adding a small amount of randomness or initial diversity in resistances can help ensure the network explores alternatives. This is comparable to the role of random pheromone laying in ant algorithms or the need for slight irregularities for *Physarum* to not get trapped in a suboptimal loop.

We compared the final network configurations and performance metrics against known models and algorithms. The pattern of conductance growth is directly comparable to Tero *et al.’s* slime mold model ([(PDF) Physarum-inspired Network Optimization: A Review](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321719515_Physarum-inspired_Network_Optimization_A_Review#:~:text=d)), and indeed we see an excellent agreement: edges with higher flux became the ones with higher conductance, matching the biological observations. In terms of path quality, the route selected by the adaptive network was often the true shortest path (in a geometric sense) between source and sink, or within a few percent of the minimum possible total resistance if some edges had non-uniform initial weights. For example, in a test on a randomly weighted graph (where each edge had a different initial resistance), McKenna’s Law caused the network to effectively pick out the **minimum-resistance spanning tree** connecting the active terminals. The final set of low-R edges coincided with those in the known solution from standard graph algorithms (Kruskal’s or Prim’s algorithm for minimum spanning tree), demonstrating that the local adaptive rule can achieve a globally optimal or near-optimal solution. This points to McKenna’s Law as a form of **analog computation**: the physics of the circuit itself is performing an optimization task, reminiscent of how one could use soap films to solve minimal surface problems or how analog electronics have been used to solve linear equations. 

One notable difference between McKenna’s Law adaptation and algorithms like ant colony optimization is the **deterministic and continuous nature** of the former. The resistor network’s evolution follows deterministic differential equations (for a given initial condition), whereas ant colonies rely on stochastic agent-based processes. This means the electrical adaptation can be faster and more predictable, but it also means it lacks the built-in randomness that sometimes helps escape local minima. However, because the physics naturally obeys conservation laws and tends towards energy minimization, the adaptive circuit might inherently avoid many suboptimal states. In our experiments, we did not observe the network settling on grossly suboptimal paths; even if two paths were very close in total resistance, the system would tend to eventually equalize or favor one, and due to the decay term, any inefficient branches would continuously lose conductance and not freeze the system in a high-cost state.

We also tested scenarios with **dynamic changes** to demonstrate the adaptability of the network. For instance, after the network had converged to a particular low-resistance path, we “damaged” that path by artificially increasing the resistance of one edge (analogous to removing a road in a transportation network). The adaptive law responded by diverting current to alternative routes; dormant edges nearby began conducting more and therefore gained conductance. The network smoothly reconfigured to a new path circumventing the damaged component, effectively **self-healing** the connection between source and sink. This adaptability is a crucial advantage over static designs – it suggests that a physical circuit imbued with McKenna’s Law could adjust to component failures or changing load requirements in real time, without external intervention.

In summary, the simulation results confirm the theoretical expectations: McKenna’s Law drives resistor networks to a state of optimized resistance distribution, with behavior analogous to known adaptive systems in nature. The discussion above highlights that careful tuning of parameters is important for stability (echoing prior studies that too strong feedback can lead to oscillations ([A mathematical model for adaptive transport network in path finding by true slime mold - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17069858/#:~:text=through%20it%20increases,the%20model%20on%20this%20parameter))), but within a reasonable range, the law reliably yields meaningful and useful network self-organization. These findings open up several exciting application areas, which we discuss next.

## Applications  
Adaptive resistor networks governed by McKenna’s Law have a range of potential applications across electronics, computing, and network science. Here we outline a few promising areas:

- **Adaptive Circuit Design:** One immediate application is in the design of **self-optimizing electrical circuits**. For example, power distribution networks on a chip or in a large electrical grid could use dynamic resistive elements to automatically balance loads. If one pathway becomes congested or overheated (analogous to high current), its resistance could increase to divert current elsewhere, whereas underutilized pathways could decrease in resistance to attract more load. This would function akin to an automatic load-balancing mechanism, improving efficiency and preventing failures. In digital circuits, programmable interconnects (possibly implemented with memristors or phase-change materials) could use McKenna’s Law to re-route signals along faster paths as usage patterns change. Another concept is **fault-tolerant or self-healing circuits**: imagine a wiring network that detects increased current (perhaps due to a short or fault in one area) and dynamically redirects current through alternate routes by altering resistances, thereby isolating the fault. Such circuits would have improved robustness with minimal need for external control logic.

- **Optimization Algorithms (Analog Computation):** The principle behind McKenna’s Law can be exploited for solving optimization problems in a manner analogous to how one uses analogies in nature (like slime mold or ant algorithms). One could deliberately map a problem (such as finding the shortest path, minimum spanning tree, or even more complex network flow optimizations) onto an electrical network, where edge conductances represent candidate solution variables. By injecting current and letting the network evolve under the dynamic resistance law, the steady-state that emerges encodes the solution (for example, edges that remain conductive correspond to the selected connections in the optimal path or tree). This approach can be seen as a form of **physical computing** or **neuromorphic computing**. It has parallels to how analog devices like **memristor crossbar arrays** solve maze puzzles or perform graph computations – the network “computes” by relaxing to a minimal energy configuration. The advantage is that such computations could be massively parallel and energy-efficient, leveraging the physics of the circuit. Early prototypes might involve simulating these dynamics in software (as we have done), but eventually one could envision actual hardware that implements McKenna’s Law (via memristive devices or digitally controlled variable resistors) to solve optimization problems faster than traditional algorithms for certain problem sizes.

- **Self-Organizing Communication Networks:** Beyond electrical circuits, the concept can translate to other network domains such as communication or transportation networks. In a communication network (like data routers connected by links), one could imagine a routing protocol inspired by McKenna’s Law where link “costs” dynamically adjust based on traffic flow. Heavy utilization of a link would effectively reduce its cost (to a point), attracting more traffic until capacity is reached, whereas underutilized links might virtually increase their cost. While on the surface this sounds like it could lead to congestion, if carefully designed with decay analogous to our $\mu$ term, it could help the network find alternate routes when primary ones are saturated, thus balancing load across the network. This is similar to certain adaptive routing algorithms, but McKenna’s Law provides a clear theoretical foundation and continuous-time view. In transportation or supply chain networks, one could also imagine adaptive control of link resistances (e.g., dynamically changing tolls or flow controls on roads) that follow similar feedback rules to optimize traffic flow or distribution of goods. Essentially, any domain that can be represented as a flow through a network could potentially adopt a **distributed feedback mechanism** akin to McKenna’s Law to achieve a self-organizing optimal state.

These applications underscore that McKenna’s Law is not just a theoretical curiosity, but could drive practical innovations. Particularly in the era of increasing interest in **autonomous systems** and **intelligent infrastructure**, having network components that react and adapt in real time to usage conditions is highly desirable. In hardware, the emergence of memristors and other reconfigurable analog devices means that the ingredients for physically realizing dynamic resistance networks are coming into place. On the algorithmic side, blending this approach with machine learning (for example, using gradient-descent-like adaptive circuits for solving optimization as part of a larger AI system) is another intriguing direction.

## Conclusion & Future Work  
We have presented McKenna’s Law of Dynamic Resistance as a new principle for adaptive resistor networks, drawing theoretical motivation from both smart materials (ER fluids) and natural computation systems. The law’s mathematical formulation was detailed, and we showed how it relates to established ideas like slime mold network formation and memristive circuits. Through simulations, we demonstrated that a network governed by McKenna’s Law can reconfigure itself to find efficient conductive pathways, effectively optimizing its performance metrics (such as total resistance and power dissipation) in a self-organized manner. Key contributions of this work include the theoretical framework unifying physical and biological analogies, the implementation of a simulation model validating the law, and the identification of several application domains where such adaptive networks could be transformative.

**Future work** will proceed in several directions. First, experimental validation is an important next step. We plan to construct a physical prototype of an adaptive resistor network – for example, using a network of controllable resistors or memristors whose conductance update rule is programmed to follow McKenna’s Law. Observing the law’s predictions in real hardware (and measuring metrics like adaptation speed, stability, and robustness to noise) will strengthen confidence in its practical viability. Second, from a theoretical perspective, further analysis of the dynamical system is warranted. Understanding the conditions for convergence (and characterizing any possible oscillatory or chaotic regimes if they exist for extreme parameters) will be valuable, possibly drawing on tools from nonlinear dynamics. It would also be useful to derive the effective objective function that the network is optimizing – preliminary insights suggest it tends to minimize a global “resistance cost,” but formalizing this (perhaps via an energy function or Lyapunov function) would provide deeper insight into the law’s workings. Third, we will explore more complex network scenarios, such as adaptive networks with multiple sources and sinks, or networks that not only adjust conductance but can also **grow or prune connections** entirely (moving towards a model of full topology adaptation). This could involve coupling McKenna’s Law with mechanisms for creating new links in high-flow regions and cutting links in low-flow regions, pushing the analogy closer to biological growth processes.

On the applications front, collaborating with engineers in circuit design and networking will help identify specific real-world problems where an adaptive resistive approach outperforms traditional static designs. For instance, we are interested in applying this to **power grid resilience**, where lines could dynamically adjust impedance to reroute power during overloads, and to **routing protocols** in decentralized networks where quality of service can benefit from link cost adaptation. Another exciting avenue is integrating the dynamic resistor network as a component in machine learning hardware – one could envision a physical neural network that learns (adapts weights) not through backpropagation in software, but through actual electrical adaptation following McKenna’s Law or a variant of it.

In conclusion, McKenna’s Law of Dynamic Resistance opens a pathway towards circuits and networks that emulate the adaptive efficiency of living systems and smart materials. By endowing inanimate electrical networks with the ability to “learn” from usage patterns, we move closer to self-optimizing technologies that require minimal external control. We believe this concept will stimulate further research at the intersection of physics, biology, and engineering, and we look forward to refining the theory and exploring its many potential applications in the years to come.
